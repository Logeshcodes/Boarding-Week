Data Structure : Theory

          =>  Way of organizing and store a data ,so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently .


            Types of Data Structure : 
                              
                1 ) Bulit-in Data Structure  : Array , object , Set , map 
                2 ) Custom Data Structure : LinkedList , Stack , Queue , HashTable , Tree , Graphs .

Algorithms : 

          =>  Set of well-defined instructions to slove the particular problem effectively and efficiently .

            Algorithm analysis : 
                  
                1 ) Time Complexity    : Amount of time taken to excute the code .
                2 ) Space Complexity  : Amount of space taken to excute the code .



Asymptotic Notation : 

          =>  Mathematical tools for represents the time and space complexity .

                1 ) Omega notation ( )   : Best-case complexity 
                2 ) Theta notation (0)     : Average-case complexity 
                3 ) Big- O notation (O) :  worst-case complexity 
            Examples : 

                1 ) Constant Time – O(1)
                2 ) Linear Time – O(n) 
                3 ) Quadratic Time – O(n^2)
                4 ) Logarithmic Time – O(log n)
